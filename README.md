# Anxiety Level Prediction
#### Video Demo: <URL>
#### Description:
Students share a burden of neverending work as they progress through high school and college. Many are unaware by what potential factors increase their buildup of anxiety aside from their work. This project uses a AI model, trained on physiological and health-related indicators, to predict an individual's potential anxiety level. The AI model is trained on a dataset involving (# of ) students and their anxietal factors. Leading factors are including but not limited to sleep quality, blood pressure, headaches, and self esteem. Students will be given a prediction from the AI model on their suggested anxiety levels, most significant factors leading to their anxiety, and potential solutions to dealing with their anxietial factors. Individuals will be able to identify leading factors of their anxiety, if any, and find solutions to lower their anxiety levels after interacting with this project.

<details><summary>Anxiety Factor Scaling (of trained AI model)</summary>

- **Anxiety**: Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) (0-21, 0 is no anxiety, 21 is severe anxiety)
- **Self-Esteem**: Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE) (0-30, 0 is high self-esteem, 30 is low self-esteem)
- **Mental Health History**: Binary (0 for no mental history, 1 for mental history available)
- **Depression**: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (0-27, 0 is no depression, 27 is severe depression)

- ***Disclaimer***: The mentioned factors (of anxiety) listed below are not officially recognized by any organization. They are declared in this document for context and interpretation. The named scales are not real and are provided for humourous effect (generated by ChatGPT) to conform with the naming conventions of the other official scales mentioned above. The scaling of each topic's intensity, however, are integrated with the AI model's training.
___
- **Headache**: Anxio-Cephalgia Index (ACI) (0-5, 0 is no headache pain, 5 is severe headache pain)
- **Blood Pressure**: Blood Pressure Severity Index (BPSI) (1-3, 1 is normal blood pressure, 3 is high blood pressure)
- **Sleep Quality**: Sleep Quality Assessment Scale (SQAS) (0-5, 0 is no difficulty with sleep, 5 is severe difficulty with sleep)
- **Breathing Problem:** Breath Harmony Index (BHI) (0-5, 0 is unrestricted breathing, 5 is severe breathing impairment)
- **Noise Level**: Tranquil Tone Index (TTI) (0-5, 0 is complete silence, 5 is extreme dissonance)
- **Living Conditions**: Habitat Comfort Meter (HCM) (0-5, 0 is ideal living standard, 5 is extreme adversity)
- **Safety**: Duct Tape Defense Index (DTDI) (0-5, 0 is a safe haven, 5 is critical safety alert)
- **Basic Needs**: Basic Needs Index (BNI) (0-5, 0 is essential fulfillment, 5 is extreme lack of essentials)
- **Academic Performance**: Academic Performance Scale (APS) (0-5, 0 is outstanding achievement, 5 is severe academic crisis)
- **Study Load**: Study Load Rating (SLR) (0-5, 0 is very light academic load, 5 is overwheming study demand)
- **Future Career Concerns**: Fortune Cookie Prophecies Barometer (FCPB) (0-5, 0 is confident career path, 5 is overwhelming career anxieties)
- **Social Support**: Entourage Entanglement Scale (EES) (0-5, 0 is abundant support network, 5 is no social support)
- **Peer Pressure**: Peer Influence Scale (PIS) (0-5, 0 is no peer influence, 5 is extreme peer influence)
- **Extracurricular Activities**: Extracurricular Overachiever-o-Meter (EOM) (0 is no involvement, 5 is active engagement)
- **Bullying**: Occasional Jokester Gauge (OJG) (0-5, 0 is no bullying incidents, 5 is severe and persistent bullying towards the individual)

<details><summary>Omitted Data (of dataset)</summary>

- **Teacher Student Relationship**: Interpreting this information is somewhat difficult and does not contribute as a considerably significant factor to one's anxiety levels.
- **Stress Level**: The purpose of the project is to assess anxiety levels based on environmental and physiological factors. Individuals' stress levels may make the AI model biased in its predictions for one's anxiety levels. The AI model may completely disregard other factors given stress levels.

### Implementation
This project utilizes a Flask app, acting as a front-end interface for the end user, to receive and display results of their anxiety levels. The backend process is powered by a Python class that trains an AI model that will predict based on given anxiety factor levels. Inputs from the end user are POSTed from a form whose values are displayed from retrieved attributes and descriptions in a database. The results are are processed through the AI model for its predictions and are sent back to the end user to receive their GAD-7 scaled anxiety level on a new page.

### Usage
Execute ``app.py`` and navigate to your local IP (or [localhost](localhost:8080)) on port 8080.

### Dependencies
```
Flask (3.0.0)
tensorflow (2.15.0)
pandas (2.1.4)
numpy (1.26.2)
scikit-learn (1.3.2)
sqlite3
```

### Suggestions
The implementation of this project is open to suggestions in the [Error](https://github.com/poibear/AnxietyPredictor/errors) section of this repository. The code is prone to sluggish execution time and is always open to optimization in all aspects (especially backend processes).
