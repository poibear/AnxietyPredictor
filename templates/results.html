    <h3>How to Lower GAD Score</h3>
    <div class="section-flex" style="padding: 0;">
        <div class="section-left">
            <p>Lowering one's score on the GAD-7 questionnaire involves adopting strategies to manage and reduce symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder.
                One approach is through relaxation techniques and stress management strategies.
                Practices such as deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness meditation can help individuals reduce physiological arousal and promote a sense of calmness.
                Engaging in regular physical activity, such as walking, jogging, or yoga, can also be beneficial for managing anxiety by releasing endorphins and reducing tension.
                Additionally, establishing a consistent sleep routine and prioritizing adequate rest can help regulate mood and reduce anxiety symptoms.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-right">
            <p>
                Another effective strategy for lowering GAD-7 scores is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), a structured psychotherapy approach that helps individuals identify and challenge negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with anxiety.
                Through CBT, individuals learn coping skills and problem-solving techniques to address worry and fear more effectively. This may involve learning to reframe irrational thoughts, practicing relaxation techniques, and gradually facing feared situations through exposure therapy.
                Furthermore, lifestyle modifications such as maintaining a healthy diet, limiting caffeine and alcohol intake, and establishing supportive social connections can also contribute to reducing anxiety symptoms and improving overall well-being.
                By implementing these strategies consistently and seeking support from mental health professionals when needed, individuals can effectively lower their GAD-7 scores and experience improved mental health outcomes.
